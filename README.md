# Working-of-Photoresistor-with-Arduino
 Overview
The Smart Light Detection and Control System is an IoT-inspired automation project built and simulated on Tinkercad.  
It uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor to detect ambient light intensity and automatically turns an LED ON or OFF based on brightness levels.  
This project demonstrates how light sensors and microcontrollers can be used to automate lighting in real-world environments.

Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE (via Tinkercad Circuits)
- Arduino UNO
- LDR Sensor (Photoresistor)
- C/C++ Programming (Arduino Language)
- Tinkercad Simulation Platform
Features
- Measures surrounding light intensity using an LDR sensor.  
- Automatically turns the LED ON in darkness and OFF in bright light.  
- Real-time simulation viewable on Tinkercad.  
- Threshold brightness level can be adjusted in code for custom sensitivity

Circuit Components
- Arduino UNO  
- LDR Sensor  
- 10kΩ Resistor (for voltage divider circuit)  
- LED  
- 220Ω Resistor  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
